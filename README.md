# DSA Mastery Plan (Python)

I, Kaushik, commit to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms in Python.  
This repo will track my progress, code, notes, and patterns.

---

## Mission
- Build **deep mastery** of DSA — from basics to advanced.
- Practice **daily** for at least 90 days.
- Solve, review, and re-solve problems until I can write clean code fast.

---

## Roadmap
1. **Foundations**: Python fluency, Big-O, recursion.
2. **Core DS**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Heaps.
3. **Trees & Graphs**: Traversals, BFS/DFS, Binary Search Trees, Tries.
4. **Classic Algorithms**: Sorting, Binary Search, Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Greedy.
5. **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, tabulation, patterns, advanced DP.
6. **Advanced DS**: Union-Find, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree, String Algos (KMP, rolling hash).
7. **Graph Advanced**: Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, MST, Max Flow.
8. **Problem-Solving Patterns**: Blind 75, NeetCode, Codeforces contests.
9. **Interview Prep**: Mock interviews, timed practice, re-solving problems.

## Daily Routine
- Warm-up: 2–3 easy problems.
- Core session: 1 medium/hard problem (plan → code → test).
- Learn: 30–45m reading/watching theory (CLRS, MIT, notes).
- Review: update tracker, Anki cards, re-solve yesterday’s tricky problem.

---

## Deliverables
- `python/` — solution code.
- `python/templates.py` — reusable code templates.
- `notes/` — explanations, key patterns.
- `tracker.csv` — log of every problem solved (date, topic, status, notes).

---

## Commitment
This is non-negotiable.  
I will **show up every single day** and build the skills that will make me unshakable in computer science.
